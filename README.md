# Systems-ProgrammingTGT


## Development tools

1. Python 3


### Prerequisites

There is only 1 Prerequisite which is very very important, that is to use python 3 do not use python2.


| Prerequisite                                                           |  Version  |
| -----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| [Python 3](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.3/Python-3.7.3.tar.xz)|`~ ^ 3.5.2`|


## Note:-

1.) The file size is ordered in descending order for better readability by this the file with max size is always on top.

2.) Few fields have been added to the json like date_captured & path supplied which can be an important information for later point in time

3.) I have used OrderedDict so that Path supplied & Date captured can be read first for human readability 

4.) The output is appended to the to a textfile called as `FileSizeDump.txt`, this file will be created in the place for the path supplied

### Script Usage
python3 getFileSize.py 'supply path here'


### Output 1


hasan@hasan-550p5c-550p7c:~/Desktop/Development/Target/Systems-ProgrammingTGT$ python3 getFileSize.py /home/hasan/Desktop/FolderSize/important\ documents/

The path is  /home/hasan/Desktop/FolderSize/important documents/

Printing the json for temporary reference, json will be appended & dumped in a text file with the name FileSizeDump.txt

```
